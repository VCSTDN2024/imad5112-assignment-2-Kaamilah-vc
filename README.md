 Challenges faced while criating the app
---------------------------

- **Challenge 1**: I was struggling placing the correct answers on the review screen, besides that the layout was always looking crowded.

 **Solution**: I watched some videos to fix it and I fixed it by correctly passing the arrays.


**Challenge 2**: The exit and restart buttons did not work.

- **Solution**: I solved issue by verifying the buttons' click listeners were configured appropriately and that they were correctly linked with findViewById.


## Future Enhancements
 
**Feature 1**: Allow users to play it offline

**Feature 2**:  Allow users to choose what language they want use to play the quiz.

**Feature 3**: Allow users to play it online in groups with friend.

**Feature 4**: Allow users answer questions by speaking instead of using buttons.
